With over 10 yearsâ€™ experience in Supply Chain Optimization Consulting in logistics and manufacturing, Jason loves diving into data to solve a breadth of complex puzzles. Jason recently completed a 12-week immersive course at [Metis](https://www.thisismetis.com/data-science-bootcamps) to understand the latest in Machine Learning to complement his prior experiences with optimization problems. A gifted story teller, Jason has a passion for presenting complex models to a wide array of audiences in an approachable manner with a focus on business value. Jason has a BA in Mathematics from Denison University and a Masters of Operations Research from North Carolina State University. For his final project, Jason classified whether two questions had the same intent or not. He utilized the model to build an app to answer user inputed questions. When Jason is not wrangling data, you can find him on a local trail exploring the Pacific Northwest.
